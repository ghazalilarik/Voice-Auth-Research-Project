### Voice Authentication Research Project

#### Introduction
This project is aimed at evaluating the strength of voice-based authentication systems by developing a dataset of voice samples and testing various methods to bypass voice authentication. The primary method used is Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is a popular approach for speaker verification.

#### Features
- **Voice Sample Dataset**: Collect and use real voice samples to train models for voice authentication.
- **Model Training**: Train Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for each speaker to build an authentication system.
- **Bypass Techniques**: Generate manipulated voice samples (e.g., pitch-shifted and time-stretched versions) to test the resilience of the models against spoofing.
- **Logging and Metrics**: Logs all key events and provides accuracy metrics to assess model performance.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **Setup Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using `pip`.
    ```sh
    pip install numpy librosa scikit-learn soundfile
    ```
2. **Prepare Voice Samples**: Collect voice samples for each speaker and organize them in the following directory structure:
   - `voice_samples/`
     - `speaker_1/`
       - `sample1.wav`
       - `sample2.wav`
     - `speaker_2/`
       - `sample1.wav`
       - `sample2.wav`
3. **Run the Research Script**: Use the following command to start the research project.
    ```sh
    python voice_authentication_research.py
    ```

#### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6 or above**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Voice Dataset**: Collect voice samples and organize them as instructed.
- **Librosa**: A Python library for analyzing audio.

#### How It Works
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Extracts MFCC features from the collected voice samples to create a dataset.
2. **GMM Training**: Trains a GMM for each speaker based on the extracted features.
3. **Authentication Testing**: Tests the model with unseen voice samples to evaluate accuracy.
4. **Bypass Testing**: Generates variations of original voice samples to simulate spoofing attacks, and assesses the model's resilience.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
3. **Configure Dataset**: Collect and arrange voice samples as instructed.
4. **Run the Script**: Run the script to perform voice authentication testing and bypass analysis.
