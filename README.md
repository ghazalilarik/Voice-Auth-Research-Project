# Voice-Auth-Research-Project
This project is aimed at evaluating the strength of voice-based authentication systems by developing a dataset of voice samples and testing various methods to bypass voice authentication. The primary method used is Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is a popular approach for speaker verification.
